# Traffic Sign Classifier using CNN and Keras (Python) - Algorithm development and Testing using 50,000 images

CNN classifier is trained using traffic sign images taken from he German Traffic Sign Benchmark is a multi-class, single-image classification challenge held at the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2011.

The dataset used in the work is not uploaded in repository due to large size of file and hence can be provided on request.

The datset contains traffic sign images each with size 32 x 32 x 3 (channel) i.e RGB
Training images = 34799
Validation images = 4410
test images = 12630
