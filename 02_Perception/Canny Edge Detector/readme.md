# Canny Edge Detector - Algorithm development and testing

Canny Edge Detection is a popular edge detection algorithm. 
It was developed by John F. Canny in 1986. It is a multi-stage algorithm and includes the following stages as shown 
in block diagram below

For testing of the algorithm, a video stream of city roads is taken and live edge detection is implemented.
