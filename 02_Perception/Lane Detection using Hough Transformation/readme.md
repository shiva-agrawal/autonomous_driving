# Lane Detection using Hough Transformation - Algorithm development and testing 
Lane detection is one of the major applications in the field of self driving cars. 
It helps to maintain the vehicle to be in the lane and provide input to lateral control of the vehicle. 
One of the ways to do lane detection and markingis by using Hough Transformation. 

Hough Transform is a popular technique to detect any shape, if we can represent that shape in mathematical form. 
It can detect the shape even if it is broken or distorted a little bit.

Following is the block diagram along with the output images at every stage of the process.
